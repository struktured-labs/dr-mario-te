"""Build drmario_copro.nes — the COPROCESSOR cartridge for the custom MiSTer NES core
(mapper 100 = MMC1 + Dr.Mario coprocessor at $5000-$51FF), with AUTO-NAV: the cart boots
itself into a VS-CPU L11 match and re-arms after every match. No controller needed (built
for a MiSTer whose physical controls are broken; also makes it a self-running demo).

How: the v28cs blob head at $FB00 (reached from the 0x37CF controller hook EVERY frame,
all modes) is repointed to the $FF54 trampoline, which bank-switches to unit-1 and runs
`main` each frame:
  menu modes  -> autonav state machine injecting P1 presses into $F5 (SELECT,SELECT,START,
                 LEFT x15, RIGHT x11, START) so the hack's own menu toggle sets VS-CPU
                 state properly; mirrors $F5->$F6 when $04=1 (P2 level cursor).
  intro (8)   -> hands off (no stray START).
  play (4)    -> the copro driver: on new pill upload board+colors to the FPGA window,
                 GO, hold pill while DONE=0, then publish best move to $DD/$DA and act.
The heavy depth-2 search runs on the SECOND 6502 inside the FPGA (~0.2-0.3s/pill vs 78s).
NOT Mesen-compatible (mapper 100) — MiSTer custom core only.

# drmario.nes in Mesen — see tmp/study_pause/): the routine blanks the background ($2001 bit3),

# We keep background rendering ON, and swap the two pause frame-waits $B654 -> $B670 (identical
# wait WITHOUT the OAM-clear tail) so the sprites in the buffer at pause entry stay put; the

# entry, so they persist. The pause loop's draw call ($97D3) is repointed to STUDY_BLOB at $D2CC
# (a 5-part trampoline routine in dead padding free in base AND v28cs) which (1) reconnects the
# "STUDY" text by setting $42=$80 then JSR $88F6 so the 5 letters land in OAM slots 32-36 (ABOVE
# every capsule/preview, so BOTH players' capsules in 2P/VS stay put), and (2) HAND-DRAWS the

# $039A/$039B) in 2P/VS — each at its mode-correct position ($0727). See STUDY_BLOB below.
