"""Build drmario_copro.nes — the COPROCESSOR cartridge for the custom MiSTer NES core
(mapper 100 = MMC1 + Dr.Mario coprocessor at $5000-$51FF), with AUTO-NAV: the cart boots
itself into a VS-CPU L11 match and re-arms after every match. No controller needed (built
for a MiSTer whose physical controls are broken; also makes it a self-running demo).

How: the v28cs blob head at $FB00 (reached from the 0x37CF controller hook EVERY frame,
all modes) is repointed to the $FF54 trampoline, which bank-switches to unit-1 and runs
`main` each frame:
  menu modes  -> autonav state machine injecting P1 presses into $F5 (SELECT,SELECT,START,
                 LEFT x15, RIGHT x11, START) so the hack's own menu toggle sets VS-CPU
                 state properly; mirrors $F5->$F6 when $04=1 (P2 level cursor).
  intro (8)   -> hands off (no stray START).
  play (4)    -> the copro driver: on new pill upload board+colors to the FPGA window,
                 GO, hold pill while DONE=0, then publish best move to $DD/$DA and act.
The heavy depth-2 search runs on the SECOND 6502 inside the FPGA (~0.2-0.3s/pill vs 78s).
NOT Mesen-compatible (mapper 100) — MiSTer custom core only.

# STUDY-draw routine (v3.2) — reconnects "STUDY" text AND hand-draws BOTH players' next-pill previews
# during pause, WITHOUT disturbing any frozen capsule, in 1P / 2-player / VS layouts. STUDY -> OAM
# slots 32-36, P1 preview -> 37-38, P2 preview (2P/VS only) -> 39-40 — all ABOVE the slot-15 gameplay
# buffer max, so BOTH players' capsules (slots 0-3 in 2P/VS) are byte-untouched. Both players consume
# the shared pill sequence at different rates, so P2's next pill ($039A/$039B) differs from P1's
# ($031A/$031B) and must show separately (the game itself draws both, $87DA/$87FE).
# A mode-correct 2-preview draw + a 2P/VS STUDY lift don't fit one dead run, so it is a 5-part trampoline through dead
# padding free in base AND v28cs (part1 in the fixed bank; parts 2-4 in bank0, where the pause routine
# already runs so they are always mapped):
#   part1 @ $D2CC: $42=$80; JSR $88F6 (STUDY -> 32-36); write P1 tiles+attr (37-38) and the 1P-default
#     P1 position (Y=$45 X=$BE/$C6, the right box); JMP part2.
#   part2 @ $9FF8: LDY $0727; DEY; BEQ RTS  (1P -> keep part1's defaults, no P2). Else (2P/VS) set
#     Y=$33 for all four preview slots (37-40) and P1 X=$38/$40 (above P1's board); JMP part3a.
#   part3a @ $A371: P2 preview tiles ($60|$039A / $70|$039B) + attr into slots 39-40; JMP part3b.
#   part3b @ $BE56: P2 preview X=$B8/$C0 (above P2's board, mirroring the game's $87FE draw); RTS.
# Tiles = $60|colorA / $70|colorB (game's own preview $8772 uses template+color via ADC, never masks
# -> raw colors are 0-2 and $60|c == $60+c). STUDY_BLOB (part1) fills the whole 52-byte $D2CC run so
# it covers any prior v2/v3/v3.1 blob when upgrading an already-patched image in place.
#   NOTE (validation basis): base-ROM change is Mesen-proven in 1P, 2P and VS-CPU (paused frame keeps
#   both capsules + STUDY + BOTH mode-correct previews showing each player's actual next pill, frozen,
#   clean resume). The copro carts are mapper 100 (not Mesen-emulable); DRSTUDY applies the SAME
#   asserted byte patches + blobs, and the 2P base test reproduces the cart's both-capsules-in-buffer
#   layout. All five dead runs must be confirmed dead in any deployed binary before surgical patching.
