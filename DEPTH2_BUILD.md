# Depth-2 cart build plan (autonomous run toward playable L11 ~67%)

## Status
- DONE+validated (py65): atomic depth-2 search `tests/test_depth2.py::build_search` 14/14 vs
  oracle `decide_d2_4`. Eval (`primitives.emit_eval::leaf_score`) 500/500. land_place 12800/12800.
  Commit 99c7a11 on branch claude/live-planner-control.
- The atomic search is the GOLD reference for the resumable version: the resumable phase machine
  must, driven frame-by-frame, pick the SAME (best_col,best_orient4) as `build_search`/`decide_d2_4`.

## The problem
Atomic search ~50M cyc/pill. NMI-hook budget ~8k cyc/frame usable (freeze above ~10-13k, proven by
the depth-1 cart). So every per-frame chunk must be <=8k. Resumable = one bounded phase per frame,
state persists in RAM ($6000 PRG-RAM, free: original Dr.Mario has no RAM chip). Slow (~hundreds of
frames/pill) but PLAYABLE; caching later.

## RAM layout (all in free $6000-$7FFF PRG-RAM + game-safe zp)
- $0500 LIVE (game settled board, read for first-ply landing). DO NOT WRITE.
- $6000-$607F CUR  (working board; all primitives operate here; first_occ reads here)
- $6080-$60FF WORK1 (board-after-first-ply, persists across the inner loop)
- $6100-$610F MARK  (find_clears bit-packed)
- $6110-$611F eval term outputs (EV_BUR/RDY/SET/VIRFLAG/WIN/SCO/M/P) -- already in primitives.py
- $6120-$613F search state (cursors, imm, best_leaf, best_value, cand) -- already in test_depth2.py
- $6140-$615F resumable extras: ST2_PC (phase counter), region cursors for split primitives
- $7A00 square table (readiness) -- for cart, copy to RAM at boot or put a ROM copy + index
- zp $CA-$E1 pool for in-phase temps (each phase self-contained, no cross-frame zp reliance)

## Resolve choice: TARGETED (DECIDED 2026-06-30)
MEASURED on L11 (faithful cart_d2_golden, rich+compact): targeted=67.5%/25% vs full=67.2%/17%.
Targeted costs NOTHING -> USE TARGETED (resolve_capped, find_clears_targeted, ~6k, ONE phase).
Atomic reference build_search keeps a `resolve` param: 'full' (=14/14 vs decide_d2_4 oracle) and
'targeted' (the cart's). Resumable cart validates vs build_search(resolve='targeted'); the
targeted primitive is independently validated (test_kernel [targeted] 4500/4500) and gives 67.5%
on L11, so atomic_targeted is the trusted reference (no separate NES targeted oracle needed).

## Phase machine (ST2_PC), per the atomic search flow
Outer cursor (O1 0..3, C1 0..7), inner cursor (O2 0..3, C2 0..7), all in RAM.
0  LAND1:  copy LIVE->CUR; land_place(O1,C1,CA,CB). illegal -> advance O1/C1, stay. legal -> PC=1.
1  RES1:   resolve (targeted=1 phase, or full=split). -> RV. (if cleared, gravity sub-phase)
2  IMM1:   calc_imm -> S_IMM; has_virus. if won -> set CAND=(1,imm1), PC=CMP.
3  SAVE1:  copy CUR->WORK1; init inner (O2=C2=0, best_leaf unset, any2=0); PC=4.
4  LAND2:  copy WORK1->CUR; land_place(O2,C2,NA,NB). illegal -> advance O2/C2, stay. legal -> PC=5.
5  RES2:   resolve. -> RV.
6  LEAF_SHAPE:   shape (~5k)            } leaf_score split so each <=8k.
7  LEAF_BURIED:  buried (~5.6k)
8  LEAF_READ_A:  readiness cells 0..63  (accumulate EO in RAM)
9  LEAF_READ_B:  readiness cells 64..127
10 LEAF_SETUP_A: setup rows pass
11 LEAF_SETUP_B: setup cols pass
12 LEAF_COMB:    has_virus + combine -> EV_WIN/EV_SCO; leaf=(EV_WIN, imm2+EV_SCO);
                 update best_leaf; advance O2/C2 -> if more PC=4 else PC=13.
13 VALUE:   value=(best_leaf_win, imm1+best_leaf_score) (or leaf(WORK1) if !any2); CAND set.
14 CMP:     cmp_update; advance O1/C1 -> if more PC=0 else PUBLISH.
15 PUBLISH: write best_col->$DD, best_orient4->$DA(via $03A5 map), ST_MODE=DONE.

NOTE: readiness/setup currently single routines; need split variants that take a region arg and
accumulate into a RAM cell across the two phases. shape/buried fit one phase as-is (<8k).

## Validation
`tests/test_depth2.py::validate_resumable`: drive arm->step*->DONE in py65, confirm
(best_col,best_orient4) == decide_d2_4 over N boards, AND every step's cycle count <=8000.

## Cart integration (patch_cartridge.py)
- slicer(depth2) in unit-1; dispatch edge+arm+step. Boards/state in $6000 (enable MMC1 PRG-RAM;
  verify writes land). 4-state wrapper: rotate $03A5 to published $DA (4 states, not 2); move to $DD.
- Keep 0x37CF->$FB00 blob (preserves P2 leveling -- DO NOT bypass). Blob JMP $FF54 = our wrapper.
- v28cs stays ship until live L11 >= v28cs.

## Eval ablation (L11, compact+targeted, 12 seeds) -- SPEED LEVERS
- full rich (shape+setup+buried+readiness): 67.5% / 25%  <- current
- drop readiness: 64.9% / 16.7%  (-2.6pp, saves the 17.5k term / 3 phases) <- best speed/acc trade
- drop setup:     60.9% / 16.7%  (setup is the KEY term -- keep it)
- setup ONLY (shape+setup): 63.9% / 8.3%   ;  buried ONLY: 38.5% (craters)
DECISION: keep full eval for now (readiness split already written+validated). When optimizing
for speed, DROP readiness first (coordinated: nes_d2_golden leaf_shape_score, 6502 combine/
leaf_score, test_leaf_score golden, then re-validate build_search vs updated oracle) -> 64.9%.
Term costs: shape 5k, buried 5.6k, setup 18k(split 2-3), readiness 17.5k(split 3: readiness_rg
done, 500/500). setup still needs a resumable rows/cols-pass split.

## Build order
1. (measure targeted L11) 2. split readiness/setup into region phases (validate cell-exact)
3. resumable phase machine + validate vs atomic 4. cart integrate 5. live L11 test 6. cache.
