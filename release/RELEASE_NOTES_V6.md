# Dr. Mario Training Edition v6

A ROM hack that combines a **VS CPU** mode (play against an AI-controlled Player 2) with an
enhanced **Study Mode** pause — freeze the game mid-play and study the board, the falling
capsule, and the upcoming pill.

## Download

**[Download BPS Patch (v6)](https://github.com/struktured-labs/dr-mario-romhacks/raw/main/release/drmario_te_v6.bps)**

Apply against an unmodified *Dr. Mario (USA)* ROM with any BPS-capable patcher
(e.g. [Floating IPS / beat](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/)).

## Features

- **VS CPU mode** — a 3rd menu option (1 PLAYER → 2 PLAYER → VS CPU) where Player 2 is
  driven by a heuristic AI, with a human-like move cadence.
- **Study Mode pause** — pressing START during play freezes the game while keeping the
  screen rendered, so positions can be studied:
  - "STUDY" text shown at the top of the screen instead of "PAUSE"
  - The full bottle, all viruses, and the **falling capsule(s)** stay visible and frozen
  - The **next-pill preview** stays visible while paused — in 2-player and VS CPU, **both
    players'** previews are shown, each above its own board *(new in v6)*
  - Pressing START again resumes cleanly with no corruption

## Changes from Original

- New VS CPU game mode with an AI-controlled Player 2
- Pause reworked into a "study" freeze: background rendering stays on, the last gameplay
  frame is held in place, and the falling capsule + next-pill preview are preserved
- "PAUSE" text replaced by "STUDY" using new tile graphics, moved to the top of the screen

## Known Limitations

- The Dr. Mario throwing figure and the magnifier viruses are not shown while paused (these
  decorative sprites are built by a game phase the freeze skips). The study-relevant content —
  bottle, viruses, falling capsule, and next-pill preview — is all shown.
- In VS CPU / 2-player mode the "STUDY" text is lifted to the very top of the screen so it clears
  the two-player score header and stays legible. Both players' capsules and both players' next-pill
  previews are preserved, each preview placed correctly above its own board.

## Compatibility

- **Base ROM:** Dr. Mario (USA) — MD5: `d3ec44424b5ac1a4dc77709829f721c9`
- **Study Mode validated on:** Mesen (headless) — 1-player, 2-player, and VS CPU pause paths
- **Mapper:** standard MMC1 (mapper 1) — runs on accurate NES emulators and the MiSTer NES core
